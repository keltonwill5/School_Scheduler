Completed
  - ASP.NET Framework is set up with almost all of the plugins installed.
  - MySQL is set up, all tables are created, stored procs are created
  - ASP.NET is connected to database, dummy code is in project demonstrating functionality from test table
  
Challenges to Discuss
  - How to host the database so that the app can connect to it (eliminates the need for everyone to download MySQL)
  
To Do
  - Figure out how to generate relational schema diagram
  - Figure out how to mass-delete items from git (anyone know how?)
  - Figure out how to upload well-structured ASP.NET Solution Folder into Git (anyone have ideas?)
  - Upload correct ASP.NET file (^ figure out above point first)
  - Upload database tables/stored procs
  - Create list of stored procs and their uses so David can use them in the back-end.
  
Notes
  - So everything I uploaded (except the MySQL tutorial) was from the wrong project (my apologies, tiredness got to me)
    > I want to delete all of those before I upload the right stuff, does anyone know how to do this quickly.
    > Should I upload the file without the front-end fixed yet, or wait till after meeting with Aris?  Nothing can happen in the file until we can get the code formatted correctly.
  - Meeting with Aris on Tuesday
    > Transfer front-end files into the framework and get them to format correctly.
    > Discuss solution for 2 missing plugins.
    > Make sure stored procs are correct for all necessary data calls.
  - Meeting with David on ??? (Soon after Tuesday)
    > Get a large chunk of the back-end done (at the very least, help with some examples), and show how to make it work with the front-end using razor.
    > Current dummy code to test the db is very bad code, just whipped up to see if connection was working. Not the correct way to do it.
    
    
  I may have forgotten some things to add here, but will remember tomorrow and bring up to discuss.
